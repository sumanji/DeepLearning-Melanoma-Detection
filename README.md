Deep Learning Melanoma Detection Assignment

Introduction
This repository contains code and resources for a deep learning assignment focused on melanoma detection. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be lethal if not detected and treated early. Deep learning techniques offer promising avenues for automating the detection of melanoma from skin images.

Dataset
The dataset used in this assignment consists of a collection of skin lesion images labeled with binary classes: melanoma and non-melanoma. 

Models
Several deep learning models are implemented and evaluated for melanoma detection, including:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Deep layer,maxpooling
Ensemble models for improved performance
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy.

Conclusion
Deep learning models show promise in automating the detection of melanoma from skin lesion images. Further research and experimentation are necessary to improve the accuracy and robustness of these models for real-world applications.
